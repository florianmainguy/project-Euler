# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.


## How to run my programs on Mac OS

#### C

- Instal Xcode
- To run gcc without GUI, type in terminal 'xcode-select --install'
- Compile your program: 'gcc program.c'
- Type './a.out'

## How to run my programs on Windows

#### Ruby

- Instal RubyInstaller
- Launch program named "Start Command Prompt with Ruby"
- Type "ruby program.rb"

#### C

- Instal GCC using MinGW
- Go to My Computer/Properties/Advanced System Settings/Environment Variable
- Go to the System Variable, find 'path' then double click on it
- Add 'C:\MinGW\bin' at the end
- In the Command Prompt, compile your program: 'gcc program.c'
- Type 'a.exe'
