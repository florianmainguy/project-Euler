# Project Euler

Solutions for the problems I solved.

## How to run my programs on Windows

### Ruby

- Instal RubyInstaller
- Launch program named "Start Command Prompt with Ruby"
- Type "ruby program.rb"

### C

- Instal GCC using MinGW
- Go to My Computer/Properties/Advanced System Settings/Environment Variable
- Go to the System Variable, find 'path' then double click on it
- Add 'C:\MinGW\bin' at the end
- In the Command Prompt, compile your program: 'gcc program.c'
- Type 'a.exe'
